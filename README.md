# 100 Days Coding Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome to my **100 Days Coding Challenge** repository!  
This repo documents my daily journey of consistent coding practice, problem-solving, and skill-building.  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Challenge
The goal is to code **every day for 100 days**, focusing on:
- Strengthening fundamentals of programming
- Solving problems across multiple topics and languages
- Building the habit of consistency
- Exploring data structures, algorithms, and real-world problem-solving

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **main branch** â†’ Documentation, progress tracking, and overall challenge log.
- **language-specific branches** (e.g., `c`, `python`, etc.) â†’ Code solutions for each language.

## âš¡ Motivation
Consistency > Intensity.  
Even small progress each day builds strong coding skills over time.
