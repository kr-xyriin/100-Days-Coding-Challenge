# 100-Days-Code
Welcome to the 100-Days-Coding-Challenge!
This repository will track my daily progress as I commit to coding for at least one hour every day over the next 100 days. The goal is to build consistent coding habits, expand my knowledge, and document what I've learned or created along the way.
Follow along to see updates, code snippets, and reflections on this journey towards becoming a better programmer.
